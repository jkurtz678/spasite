Questions:

What do we like about the existing sites?
- They are easy and simple tools. Other sites are way too complex, difficult for not non tech people to figure out

What makes your business unique
- Alot of businesses say they use the top quality product, but they dont. Emphasize top quality product, and care itself.
- Wants patients to feel like a family, developing a relationship, making sure people are taken care of

Im trying to figure out the homepage, what do you want people to know when they first visit your site?
- Focus on the facial and skincare to start. Massages are not the focus. Facial is the most important
- Spa special
- Generic photos and text are fine to start

Other sites start with some copy or text explaining or summarizing the business, do you have any ideas for that? 
- not yet but will get back to you

Are you fine with the page structure that matches the other sites like comfort day spa brea? Homepage and then skincare and massage being separate pages?
- yes thats fine

Contact info, domain name, business name, that will be needed but I assume will come later? 
- Yes later, we will need help setting up the domain name
